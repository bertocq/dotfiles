# Bash shell customizations
## Set bash colors
export CLICOLOR=true
export LS_COLORS='di=32:ln=36:ex=31:or=37;41'

## Avoid duplicates in bash history & increase history memory & file sizes
export HISTSIZE=10000
export HISTFILESIZE=100000
export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
# Increase history memory & file sizes
HISTSIZE=100000
HISTFILESIZE=200000
# Following lines do this:
#  - If the same command is entered again consecutively, store only one copy
#  - Save history after every command, so that even if the terminal
#    crashes/force-killed you have saved history. Note that the side-effect of
#    this is that if you execute a command in a terminal, it will be visible in
#    another simultaneously running terminal's history as soon as you execute
#    even one command in the new terminal
#  - If a command is entered which was previously typed in the past (but not
#    consecutively), remove all previous instances from history and add only one
#    new instance, effectively removing all duplicates from history, including
#    non-consecutive ones
shopt -s histappend # append to the history file instead of overwriting
PROMPT_COMMAND="history -n; history -w; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups

## Customize bash behaviour
shopt -s autocd # type directory name to cd into it
shopt -s cdspell # correct directory name spelling errors
shopt -s checkwinsize # adjust lines & columns after each command
shopt -s cmdhist # store multi-line commands in single history entry
